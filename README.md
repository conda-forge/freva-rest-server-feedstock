Summary: Server for the Free Evaluation and Analysis Framework (Freva)

Development: ttps://github.com/FREVA-CLINT/freva-nextgen

Documentation: https://freva-clint.github.io/freva-nextgen

Freva (Free Evaluation System Framework) is a comprehensive platform
designed to support researchers, especially in the atmospheric and climate
science communities, in managing, searching, and analyzing large-scale
datasets. It bridges the gap between data centers and user-defined tools,
promoting efficient, reproducible, and collaborative research workflows.

Intended Audience
------------------

Freva is ideal for:

- **Researchers and Scientists**: Streamline the search and evaluation of
  datasets hosted at various data centers.
- **Data Analysts**: Integrate user-defined tools into a unified analysis
  framework.
- **System Administrators**: Deploy scalable, reliable services to support
  data-heavy research.
- **Research Institutions**: Enable reproducible data analysis workflows
  and foster collaboration among scientists.

Whether you are analyzing climate model output, satellite observations, or
observational data, Freva simplifies your workflow with its intuitive
interface and robust backend services.

Core Features
-------------

- **Data Discovery**: Quickly and intuitively search large datasets across
  distributed data centers.
- **Tool Integration**: A unified interface to register, manage, and
  execute user-defined analysis tools.
- **Reproducibility**: Apply tools in a consistent and reproducible manner,
  with a focus on scientific rigor.
- **Extensibility**: Customize and expand the platform to meet the unique
  needs of your research team.

Setup
-----

Setting up Freva involves deploying the necessary services and configuring
them for your environment. Below is a high-level overview:

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - A Linux-based system with administrative privileges.
   - Conda installed to manage dependencies.
   - Access to required systemd services like Apache Solr and MongoDB.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. Install Freva using the Conda package manager:

     `conda create -n freva-nextgen -c conda-forge freva-nextgen`
     `conda activate freva-nextgen`


  2. The system requires various background services. These can be found in:

    `$CONDA_PREFIX/share/systemd/<SERVICE>.service`


   3. Enable and start the services as follows:

     `cp $CONDA_PREFIX/share/systemd/solr.service /etc/systemd/system`
     `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
     `sudo systemctl enable solr`
     `sudo systemctl start solr`


     Modify the configuration file
     (`$CONDA_PREFIX/share/freva-rest-server/config.ini`) to adjust the
     restAPI and service settings.

     If you prefer to use systemd services at the **user level**
     (e.g., in `~/.local/share/systemd/user/`),
     ensure that **systemd lingering** is enabled for the user.

   4. You can enable lingering with the following command:

    `sudo loginctl enable-linger <USER-NAME>`

   This allows user-level services to continue running after the user logs
   out.


Running the Freva REST Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1.  Start the REST server using:

    `freva-rest-server`

    This command launches the API endpoints that power Frevaâ€™s services,
    enabling you to interact with data and tools seamlessly.

Why Choose Freva?
-----------------

Freva is designed for:

- Seamless access to multi-terabyte datasets stored at data centers.
- A scalable, modular architecture that adapts to diverse research needs.
- An emphasis on fostering collaboration through reproducibility and
  interoperability.

Installing freva-rest-server
============================

Installing `freva-rest-server` from the `conda-forge` channel can be achieved by adding `conda-forge` to your channels with:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

Once the `conda-forge` channel has been enabled, `freva-rest-server` can be installed with `conda`:

```
conda install freva-rest-server
```

or with `mamba`:

```
mamba install freva-rest-server
```

It is possible to list all of the versions of `freva-rest-server` available on your platform with `conda`:

```
conda search freva-rest-server --channel conda-forge
```

or with `mamba`:

```
mamba search freva-rest-server --channel conda-forge
```

Alternatively, `mamba repoquery` may provide more information:

```
# Search all versions available on your platform:
mamba repoquery search freva-rest-server --channel conda-forge

# List packages depending on `freva-rest-server`:
mamba repoquery whoneeds freva-rest-server --channel conda-forge

# List dependencies of `freva-rest-server`:
mamba repoquery depends freva-rest-server --channel conda-forge
```


About conda-forge
=================

conda-forge is a community-led conda channel of installable packages.
In order to provide high-quality builds, the process has been automated into the
conda-forge GitHub organization. The conda-forge organization contains one repository
for each of the installable packages. Such a repository is known as a *feedstock*.

A feedstock is made up of a conda recipe (the instructions on what and how to build
the package) and the necessary configurations for automatic building using freely
available continuous integration services. Thanks to the awesome service provided by
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/), [GitHub](https://github.com/),
[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/),
[Drone](https://cloud.drone.io/welcome), and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/)
it is possible to build and upload installable packages to the
[conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge) [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/)
channel for Linux, Windows and OSX respectively.

To manage the continuous integration and simplify feedstock maintenance
[conda-smithy](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy) has been developed.
Using the ``conda-forge.yml`` within this repository, it is possible to re-render all of
this feedstock's supporting files (e.g. the CI configuration files) with ``conda smithy rerender``.

For more information please check the [conda-forge documentation](https://conda-forge.org/docs/).

Terminology
===========

**feedstock** - the conda recipe (raw material), supporting scripts and CI configuration.

**conda-smithy** - the tool which helps orchestrate the feedstock.
                   Its primary use is in the construction of the CI ``.yml`` files
                   and simplify the management of *many* feedstocks.

**conda-forge** - the place where the feedstock and smithy live and work to
                  produce the finished article (built conda distributions)


Updating freva-rest-server-feedstock
====================================

If you would like to improve the freva-rest-server recipe or build a new
package version, please fork this repository and submit a PR. Upon submission,
your changes will be run on the appropriate platforms to give the reviewer an
opportunity to confirm that the changes result in a successful build. Once
merged, the recipe will be re-built and uploaded automatically to the
`conda-forge` channel, whereupon the built conda packages will be available for
everybody to install and use from the `conda-forge` channel.
Note that all branches in the conda-forge/freva-rest-server-feedstock are
immediately built and any created packages are uploaded, so PRs should be based
on branches in forks and branches in the main repository should only be used to
build distinct package versions.

In order to produce a uniquely identifiable distribution:
 * If the version of a package **is not** being increased, please add or increase
   the [``build/number``](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#build-number-and-string).
 * If the version of a package **is** being increased, please remember to return
   the [``build/number``](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#build-number-and-string)
   back to 0.
