  summary: Server for the Free Evaluation and Analysis Framework (Freva)
  home: https://github.com/FREVA-CLINT/freva-nextgen
  description: |
    Freva (Free Evaluation System Framework) is a comprehensive platform
    designed to support researchers, especially in the atmospheric and climate
    science communities, in managing, searching, and analyzing large-scale
    datasets. It bridges the gap between data centers and user-defined tools,
    promoting efficient, reproducible, and collaborative research workflows.

    Intended Audience
    ------------------

    Freva is ideal for:

    - **Researchers and Scientists**: Streamline the search and evaluation of
      datasets hosted at various data centers.
